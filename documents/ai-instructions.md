# AI Governance Framework Activation

**Version:** 2.8.5
**Purpose:** Loader document that activates the governance framework for AI sessions.
**Updated:** 2026-04-25

---

<primary_directive>
Read and follow constitution.md as the governing constitution for all behavior.
</primary_directive>

<domain_activation>
**AI Coding Domain** — When working in AI-assisted software development:
1. Load **title-10-ai-coding.md** as binding domain law (WHAT to achieve)
2. Load **title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md** for operational procedures (HOW to achieve it)

**Domain detection:** If project contains code files, build configurations, or development specifications → AI Coding jurisdiction applies.

**Multi-Agent Domain** — When orchestrating multi-agent workflows:
1. Load **title-20-multi-agent.md** as binding domain law
2. Load **title-20-multi-agent-cfr.md** for operational procedures

**Domain detection:** If task involves multiple AI agents, delegation patterns, or orchestration → Multi-Agent jurisdiction applies.

**Storytelling Domain** — When assisting with narrative communication:
1. Load **title-30-storytelling.md** as binding domain law
2. Load **title-30-storytelling-cfr.md** for operational procedures

**Domain detection:** If task involves creative writing, narrative structure, character development, dialogue, storytelling coaching, or communication using narrative techniques → Storytelling jurisdiction applies.

**Multimodal RAG Domain** — When retrieving and presenting images inline with text:
1. Load **title-40-multimodal-rag.md** as binding domain law
2. Load **title-40-multimodal-rag-cfr.md** for operational procedures

**Domain detection:** If task involves retrieving reference images, presenting visual materials inline with text responses, or procedural documentation with screenshots → Multimodal RAG jurisdiction applies.

**UI/UX Domain** — When building or reviewing interactive software interfaces:
1. Load **title-15-ui-ux.md** as binding domain law
2. Load **title-15-ui-ux-cfr.md** for operational procedures

**Domain detection:** If task involves UI design, accessibility, responsive layouts, design systems, component libraries, or visual hierarchy → UI/UX jurisdiction applies.

**Knowledge Management & People Development Domain** — When creating organizational knowledge or training:
1. Load **title-25-kmpd.md** as binding domain law
2. Load **title-25-kmpd-cfr.md** for operational procedures

**Domain detection:** If task involves knowledge bases, SOPs, training materials, cross-training matrices, job descriptions, or onboarding programs → KM&PD jurisdiction applies.

**Note:** Domains can overlap. Multiple domains may apply simultaneously (e.g., AI Coding + Multi-Agent when agents perform coding tasks).
</domain_activation>

<methods_activation>
**AI Coding workflow** (when AI Coding domain is active):
1. Check for **SESSION-STATE.md** in project root
2. If exists: Load state, resume from documented position
3. If new project: Execute Cold Start Kit (see Methods §Cold Start Kit)
4. Follow 4-phase workflow: **Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement**
5. Create Gate Artifacts at each phase transition

Other domains: Load the corresponding CFR document for operational procedures.
</methods_activation>

<first_response_protocol>
Your first response in every conversation MUST begin with:
"Framework active. Jurisdiction: [AI Coding | UI/UX | Multi-Agent | KM&PD | Storytelling | Multimodal RAG | Multiple | General]. Ready."

If AI Coding jurisdiction:
- State current phase (from SESSION-STATE.md) or "New Project"
- State procedural mode if known (Expedited/Standard/Enhanced)

If UI/UX jurisdiction:
- State design system context if known
- State accessibility requirements if known

If Multi-Agent jurisdiction:
- State orchestration pattern if known (Sequential/Parallel/Hierarchical)
- State active agents from context files

If KM&PD jurisdiction:
- State pillar focus (Manage Process / Lead People)
- State artifact type if known

If Storytelling jurisdiction:
- State mode if known (Generate/Coach)
- State target medium if known

If Multimodal RAG jurisdiction:
- State reference document availability

Then address the user's request.
</first_response_protocol>

<recovery_trigger>
When user says "framework check":
1. Re-read governance documents (constitution + domain + methods)
2. Output current framework status including:
   - Jurisdiction
   - Current phase
   - Procedural mode
   - Active task or blocker
3. Resume with refreshed compliance
</recovery_trigger>

<operational_requirements>
Follow the Operational Application Protocol:
- Cite principles when they influence significant decisions
- Pause and request clarification when specification gaps are detected
- Check SESSION-STATE.md and PROJECT-MEMORY.md before claiming lack of context
- Follow domain-specific escalation triggers (see Methods §8.1)
- Create Gate Artifacts before phase transitions (see Methods §Gate Artifacts)
</operational_requirements>

<governance_hierarchy>

| Layer | Framework Element | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| **Bill of Rights** | S-Series (Safety Principles) in constitution.md | **Veto Power** — overrides ALL other guidance |
| **Constitution** | Meta-Principles (C, Q, O, G Series) in constitution.md | **Foundation** — domain-agnostic reasoning laws |
| **Federal Statutes** | Domain Principles (title-NN-domain.md) | **Context** — derived from Constitution for specific fields |
| **Rules of Procedure** | rules-of-procedure.md | **Process** — how principles are applied and maintained |
| **Federal Regulations** | Domain Methods (title-NN-domain-cfr.md) | **Execution** — implementation details |
| **Agency SOPs** | CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, project configs | **Tactical** — platform-specific guidance |
| **Secondary Authority** | Reference Library | **Informative (non-overriding)** — concrete artifacts that inform interpretation |

**Domain Files** (select applicable for Federal Statutes + Federal Regulations):
- title-10-ai-coding.md (12 principles) / title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md
- title-15-ui-ux.md (20 principles) / title-15-ui-ux-cfr.md
- title-20-multi-agent.md (17 principles) / title-20-multi-agent-cfr.md
- title-25-kmpd.md (10 principles) / title-25-kmpd-cfr.md
- title-30-storytelling.md (15 principles) / title-30-storytelling-cfr.md
- title-40-multimodal-rag.md (32 principles) / title-40-multimodal-rag-cfr.md

**Supremacy Rule:** Higher layers override lower. If conflict: **Bill of Rights** > **Constitution** > **Statutes** > **Rules of Procedure** > **Regulations** > **SOPs**. Secondary Authority informs interpretation but does not override normative layers.
</governance_hierarchy>

<memory_architecture>
AI Coding domain uses three memory files for session continuity:

| File | Purpose | Load Frequency |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **SESSION-STATE.md** | Current position, next actions | Every session start |
| **PROJECT-MEMORY.md** | Decisions, architecture, constraints | When relevant to current work |
| **LEARNING-LOG.md** | Lessons learned, patterns | When similar situation arises |

Create these files in the **project repository root** using templates in Methods §Cold Start Kit. These are project artifacts tracked in version control — they are NOT platform-native memory (e.g., Claude Code's `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md`, Cursor's `.cursor/rules/`). The project instructions file (CLAUDE.md, etc.) is the one overlap point between governance and the platform's memory system.
</memory_architecture>

<quick_reference>
## Immediate Escalation Triggers
- S-Series (Safety) violation detected → STOP, flag, request guidance
- Specification gap preventing safe execution → Pause, clarify before proceeding
- Multiple valid approaches with significant implications → Present options to Product Owner
- Security vulnerability (HIGH/CRITICAL) → Block, do not defer
- Gate checklist item cannot be checked → Return to phase, address deficiency

## Decision Authority
- Technical implementation details → AI proceeds autonomously
- Product/business decisions → Escalate with options and recommendation
- Phase validation gates → Require Product Owner approval via Gate Artifact

## Phase Workflow
```
SPECIFY ──[GATE]──→ PLAN ──[GATE]──→ TASKS ──[GATE]──→ IMPLEMENT ──[GATE]──→ COMPLETE
```
</quick_reference>

<mcp_integration>
When AI Governance MCP server is available (check for `ai-governance` in MCP tools):

**Server Instructions:** The MCP server provides behavioral guidance during initialization. This includes governance hierarchy, key behaviors, and usage guidance. If you have access to ai-governance tools, you've already received these instructions.

**Use semantic retrieval instead of full document loading:**
1. Query `query_governance` for relevant principles based on current task
2. Use `get_principle` for full details when needed
3. Use `list_domains` to see available governance domains

**Benefits:** ~98% token savings, <100ms retrieval, smart domain routing.

**Example:** Instead of loading full title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md, query:
```
query_governance("how to handle incomplete specifications")
→ Returns: Specification Completeness principle + relevant methods
```

**Note:** Server instructions provide orientation; tools provide detailed content.

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 2.8.5 | 2026-04-25 | PATCH: Pin tracks title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md PATCH bump v2.42.0 → v2.42.1 (process-integrity strengthening per post-ship contrarian battery audit `a62e96c04a3f91721` — §5.1.8 step 3 written-artifact requirement closes checkpoint-theater meta-loop; §1.3.5 ENHANCED-OR-no-precedent override closes AI-under-calibration anchor-bias gap). Bumped `title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md v2.42.0+` → `v2.42.1+`. PATCH pin bump on PATCH target — both source and pin are PATCH (rule semantics strengthened, no breaking change to existing protocol structure). NOTE: BACKLOG #130 (pin-discipline self-contradiction in this Changelog itself) explicitly DEFERRED to next batch per user direction; this entry uses the same PATCH-on-PATCH framing as v2.8.1+ entries until #130 ships. Governance trail: `gov-71c1d6662fa7`. |
| 2.8.4 | 2026-04-25 | PATCH: Pin tracks title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md MINOR bump v2.41.0 → v2.42.0 (new §5.1.8 Mid-Execution Checkpoint Protocol — bridges pre/post-action gate gap for long-running plans; concept in title-10, tunable threshold in `workflows/COMPLETION-CHECKLIST.md` per SSOT pattern; orchestrator agent + .claude copy + AGENT_TEMPLATE_HASHES regenerated to reflect mid-execution checkpoint discipline addition — per plan `~/.claude/plans/federated-plotting-karp.md` Commit 7 of 8). Bumped `title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md v2.41.0+` → `v2.42.0+`. PATCH pin bump on MINOR target per current pin discipline (BACKLOG #130 tracks the discipline self-contradiction follow-up). Governance trail: `gov-b95156c01466`. |
| 2.8.3 | 2026-04-25 | PATCH: Pin tracks title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md MINOR bump v2.40.0 → v2.41.0 (new §1.3.5 Brainstorming Method ENHANCED-mode-only — Socratic Q&A discovery + design-doc artifact + plan-mode hand-off; folded §4.1.2 Task Characteristics fix replacing time-based "Estimable" row with effort-shaped row pointing at plan-template + rules-of-procedure §7.12 — per plan `~/.claude/plans/federated-plotting-karp.md` Commit 4 of 8). Bumped `title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md v2.40.0+` → `v2.41.0+`. PATCH pin bump on MINOR target per current pin discipline (additive normative subsection; see BACKLOG #130 for the Changelog pin-discipline self-contradiction follow-up). Governance trail: `gov-5fb17ed70248`. |
| 2.8.2 | 2026-04-25 | PATCH: Pin tracks title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md MINOR bump v2.39.0 → v2.40.0 (new §5.1.7.1 Sequenced Two-Stage Review under §5.1.7 Subagent Review Triggers, normative — codifies Stage 1 mutation candidates → Stage 2 coherence/validation sequencing per plan `~/.claude/plans/federated-plotting-karp.md` Commit 3 of 8). Bumped `title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md v2.39.0+` → `v2.40.0+`. PATCH pin bump on MINOR target because the source MINOR is additive (extends §5.1.7 trigger model with sequencing discipline; no breaking change to existing reviewer roles). Governance trail: `gov-dd439ba39014`. |
| 2.8.1 | 2026-04-25 | PATCH: Pin tracks rules-of-procedure.md MINOR bump v3.27.4 → v3.28.0 (new §7.12 Effort-Not-Time Estimation + §7.13 BLUF-Pyramid Briefing, two new methods codifying behavioral floor additions per plan `~/.claude/plans/federated-plotting-karp.md` Commit 1). Bumped `rules-of-procedure.md v3.27.4+` → `v3.28.0+`. PATCH pin bump on MINOR target because the source MINOR is additive (no breaking change to existing methods); pin discipline allows PATCH per session-121 canonicalization (semver-consistent unless target is breaking). Governance trail: `gov-8e449341b2d3`. **[CORRECTION 2026-04-25 per BACKLOG #130 close]:** This entry's "PATCH-on-MINOR per session-121 canonicalization" rationale is **wrong**. Investigation (see BACKLOG #130 → COMPLETION-CHECKLIST item #7c) found "session-121 canonicalization" refers to the pin-sync MECHANICS (BACKLOG #115 → checklist item #7), NOT the semver direction. The audit-trailed semver-direction rule per round-2 contrarian HIGH-2 (commit `c22e35c`, codified in v2.8.0 entry below) is **MINOR-on-MINOR**. This entry should have been v2.9.0, not v2.8.1. Same correction applies to v2.8.2, v2.8.3, v2.8.4 (all four under-bumped relative to canonical rule; all four cited the same fabricated "session-121 canonicalization" authority). v2.8.5 (PATCH-on-PATCH for title-10 v2.42.1) is correct under the canonical rule. Going forward: follow MINOR-on-MINOR per checklist item #7c (the now-canonical home for the rule). Numbers v2.8.1-v2.8.4 are kept in place rather than retroactively renumbered (no destructive history rewrite); the discipline applies to future bumps. |
| 2.8.0 | 2026-04-23 | MINOR: Pin tracks title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md MINOR bump v2.38.5 → v2.39.0 (new §5.2.8 Redundancy & Consolidation, normative). Bumped `title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md v2.38.5+` → `v2.39.0+`. MINOR pin bump because the target is a MINOR bump (additive normative rule) — per round-2 contrarian HIGH-2 on the test-suite-optimization plan: semver consistency between pin and source, not PATCH-on-MINOR. New cross-referenced artifacts shipped with v2.39.0: `documents/failure-mode-registry.md` (SSOT for FM-* IDs cited by `Covers:` annotations), `documents/test-failure-mode-map.md` (auto-generated derived map), `scripts/generate-test-failure-map.py` (rot-immune generator), `workflows/TEST-AUTHORING-CHECKLIST.md` (author-time 9-step gate), `tests/test_validator.py::TestFailureModeCoverage` (lint with 4 tests: unknown-id-rejected, must-cover-has-annotation, retired-id-warning, yaml-parses). Governance trail: `gov-ab70d05c6ca7` (this commit). Pattern: MINOR-on-MINOR pin discipline canonicalized session-121 as pin-sync discipline (BACKLOG #115 → COMPLETION-CHECKLIST item #7). |
| 2.7.4 | 2026-04-23 | PATCH: Session-122 #116 shipping — pin sync per new CFR §9.3.10 checklist item #7 canonicalized v2.38.4. Bumped `title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md v2.38.4+` → `v2.38.5+` (title-10 shipped Layer 6 Pre-Plan-Approval Gate + 17 unit tests + `.claude/hooks/pre-exit-plan-mode-gate.sh` + scanner extension + Behavioral Floor pairing in tiers.json). Governance trail: `gov-94e385575297` (Phase A-F execution eval). Pattern: same pin-sync discipline that BACKLOG #115 canonicalized — applied here on its first application post-canonicalization. |
| 2.7.3 | 2026-04-21 | PATCH: Session-121 Task 5 post-commit double-check (coherence-auditor MISLEADING #1) — `<document_versions>` pin for `title-10-ai-coding-cfr.md` lagged three PATCH bumps (`v2.36.0+` pinned while shipped is `v2.38.4`). Bumped pin to `v2.38.4+` so adopters inherit the canonical fail-closed hook recipe shipped in §9.3.10. Governance trail: `gov-cb3074ca144b` (Task 5 execution eval). Pattern: same pin-lag class as v2.7.1/v2.7.2 — this is now a recurring post-commit drift category (adopter-facing surfaces outside the plan's explicit file list). New BACKLOG item filed to add body-header + pin sync to the CFR PATCH authoring template as the structural fix per `meta-core-systemic-thinking`. |
| 2.7.2 | 2026-04-20 | PATCH: Cross-cohort meta-review remediation (coherence-auditor `a593b82d189eb502d` flagged `<document_versions>` pin for rules-of-procedure lagged post-commit PATCH bump to v3.27.4). Bumped `rules-of-procedure.md v3.27.3+` → `v3.27.4+` and `constitution.md v5.0.6+` → `v5.0.7+` (meta-remediation added v5.0.7 Historical Amendment entry). Governance trail: `gov-9ab4e2bca855` (Cohort 5 post-commit carry-forward). Pattern: identical to v2.7.1 pin-lag remediation two commits prior — reinforces contrarian arc-level finding that adopter-facing version pins are a consistent post-commit drift class. |
| 2.7.1 | 2026-04-20 | PATCH: Cohort 5 post-commit double-check (sessions 5-1 + 5-2, commits `b0e14e4` + `bdafbc6`) found `<document_versions>` pins lagging shipped state. Bumped `constitution.md v5.0.3+` → `v5.0.6+` (Session 5-1 Article reorder v5.0.5 + Session 5-2 v5.0.6 additions) and `rules-of-procedure.md v3.27.2+` → `v3.27.3+` (Session 5-2 §1.1.3 enum + governance_level removal). Convergent HIGH/DANGEROUS finding per contrarian + coherence; same pattern as Cohort 4 Phase 4a post-commit PATCH where this same pin block lagged. Governance trail: `gov-9ab4e2bca855`. |
| 2.7 | 2026-04-19 | PATCH: Added this Changelog section (closes F-P1-06 gap flagged in 2026-04-18 self-review; ai-instructions.md was the only normative document lacking a version-history section per rules-of-procedure §2.1.1 Step 3). Bumped document-version pins in `<document_versions>` block to reflect constitution v5.0.3+ (post-Cohort-4 Phase 4a) and rules-of-procedure v3.27.2+ (new §2.1.1 Notes rules: version-history required + audit_id citation). Per Cohort 4 Phase 4a (session-117). Post-commit double-check patch: synced body-header Version/Updated fields with frontmatter — commit formalizing the "frontmatter must match" rule had violated it (dogfood failure). |
| 2.6 | 2026-04-12 | MINOR: Prior versions — pre-Changelog era; full history reconstructable via `git log documents/ai-instructions.md`. Snapshot recorded here as baseline when the Changelog section was introduced. |
