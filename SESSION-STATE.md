# Session State

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31

## Current Position

- **Phase:** Implement (complete)
- **Mode:** Standard
- **Active Task:** None (between tasks)
- **Blocker:** None

## Immediate Context

Reviewed Gemini 2.5 Pro's constructive review of ai-governance-mcp. Applied 80/20 analysis to 7 recommendations: 2 already implemented, 1 tested and disproven, 3 rejected for low ROI, 1 acknowledged (on roadmap). No changes needed. Review archived.

## Next Actions

1. Ready for next user request
2. Consider additional governance domains if expanding coverage
3. Vector database migration when multi-user scaling needed

## Session Notes

Key validation: Tested domain routing with off-topic queries ("legal contract review", "cooking pasta", "fantasy novel"). All correctly returned Constitution-only, proving negative keywords unnecessary. System well-designed per external review.
