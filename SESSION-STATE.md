### Title 12: RAG Optimization Techniques

**Trigger:** User requested RAG optimization consolidation (same pattern as PE).

**Analysis:**
- RAG document reviewed: primarily techniques, not principles
- Constitution already covers underlying principles (source attribution, hallucination prevention)
- Same pattern as PE → techniques go in Methods, not new domain

| AI-instructions-prompt-engineering-and-rag-optimization.md | Archived |
| MULTI-AGENT-ENHANCEMENT-REPORT.md | Archived (one-time report) |
