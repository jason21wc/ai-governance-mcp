## Current Position

- **Phase:** Implement (Complete)
- **Mode:** Standard
- **Active Task:** None
- **Blocker:** None

## Recent Work (This Session)

### Progressive Inquiry Protocol (Complete)
- Added principle to Constitution (ai-interaction-principles-v2.1.md)
- Added method Part 7.9 to ai-governance-methods v3.3.1
- Format guidance: Foundation → open-ended; Refinement → structured options

### Governance Enforcement Research (Paused)
- Researched automatic enforcement patterns (proxy, hooks, middleware)
- Key finding: True enforcement requires architectural control outside MCP
- Decision: Pause — current instruction-based approach sufficient for now
- See: PROJECT-MEMORY decision, LEARNING-LOG research entry
