# Session State

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31

## Current Position

- **Phase:** Implement (complete)
- **Mode:** Standard
- **Active Task:** None (governance enforcement improvements complete)
- **Blocker:** None

## Immediate Context

Identified gap: Governance reminder was present but AI didn't actively apply it. Implemented phased solution:

**Phase 1 (Complete):**
- Enhanced GOVERNANCE_REMINDER with explicit action triggers
- Added Mandatory Governance Checkpoints to CLAUDE.md
- Documented in PROJECT-MEMORY and LEARNING-LOG

**Phase 2 (Roadmap):**
- Governance Agent as specialized agent in multi-agent architecture
- Added to README roadmap under multi-agent orchestration

## Next Actions

1. Ready for next user request
2. Multi-agent orchestration with Governance Agent when that work begins
3. Docker containerization for distribution

## Session Notes

Per meta-quality-verification-mechanisms-before-action: Queried governance before implementation. Cited principles in decision documentation. 220 tests passing.
